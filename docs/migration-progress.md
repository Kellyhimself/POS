## ðŸ”„ In Progress

### 1. Legacy Hook Cleanup
- ðŸ”„ Remove unused legacy hook files
- ðŸ”„ Clean up any remaining references
- ðŸ”„ Update migration helper script

## ðŸ“‹ Pending Migrations

### 1. Legacy Hook Files (Safe to Remove)
Based on migration helper scan, these are only referenced in their own files:

- `src/lib/hooks/useGlobalEtimsSync.ts` - Hook definition (can be removed)
- `src/lib/hooks/useGlobalProductCache.ts` - Hook definition (can be removed)
- `src/lib/hooks/useGlobalProductSync.ts` - Hook definition (can be removed)
- `src/lib/hooks/useGlobalPurchaseSync.ts` - Hook definition (can be removed)
- `src/lib/hooks/useGlobalSaleSync.ts` - Hook definition (can be removed)
- `src/lib/hooks/useGlobalSupplierSync.ts` - Hook definition (can be removed)

### 2. Additional Features
- Real-time subscriptions for online mode
- Enhanced sync status indicators
- Offline-first features (local caching, conflict resolution)
- Performance optimizations

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

## ðŸ“Š Migration Metrics

- **Total files to migrate**: 6 (legacy hooks only)
- **Files completed**: 10 (major components including reports and purchases)
- **Files in progress**: 1 (legacy hook cleanup)

   - Automatic mode switching
   - Mode-specific features and behaviors

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Seamless transitions between modes
   - Clear feedback about current mode
   - Appropriate UI for each mode

4. **Future Proof**
   - Easy to add new features
   - Consistent architecture
   - Better scalability

## ðŸ”§ Development Notes

### Key Patterns Used
1. **Mode-aware query keys**: Include `currentMode` in React Query keys
2. **Unified service calls**: Use `getProducts()`, `createSale()`, `getPurchases()`, etc.
3. **Mode indicators**: Show current mode status in UI
4. **Error handling**: Mode-specific error messages and handling

### Best Practices
1. Always include `currentMode` in query keys for data that changes with mode
2. Use the unified service methods instead of direct API calls
3. Add mode indicators to key pages
4. Test thoroughly in both online and offline modes
5. Handle mode-specific features appropriately

## ðŸš€ Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy with old hooks still available (current state)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete all migrations and remove old hooks
3. **Phase 3**: Add enhanced features and optimizations
4. **Phase 4**: Full dual-mode production deployment
