# Responsive Design Plan

## Overview
This document details the plan for making the POS & Inventory System fully responsive, targeting mobile devices with widths below 480px, 409px, and 380px. The goal is to ensure all critical functionalities remain intact while providing an optimal user experience on small screens.

---

## 1. Objectives
- Ensure all pages and components are usable and visually clear on small screens.
- Maintain separation of concerns: UI logic, business logic, and data fetching should remain modular.
- Safeguard all critical workflows (sales, purchases, sync, settings, etc.).
- Use a consistent design system and responsive utility classes.

---

## 2. Breakpoints
- **480px**: General mobile breakpoint. Adjust layouts, navigation, and font sizes.
- **409px**: For smaller phones. Stack elements, simplify tables, and increase touch targets.
- **380px**: For the smallest supported devices. Collapse non-essential UI, use full-width modals, and hide advanced options behind toggles.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Audit & Mapping
- List all pages and components.
- Map dependencies and shared UI elements.

### Step 2: Design System & Utilities
- Define CSS/SCSS/Styled Components breakpoints.
- Create utility classes/mixins for common responsive behaviors.

### Step 3: Layout Refactoring
- Refactor main layouts to use flexbox/grid and fluid units.
- Convert sidebars to bottom navs or hamburger menus on mobile.

### Step 4: Component Responsiveness
- Make tables scrollable or card-based on mobile.
- Stack form fields vertically and increase input/button sizes.
- Ensure modals are mobile-friendly (full-screen or bottom sheet).

### Step 5: Page-Specific Adjustments
- POS: Thumb-friendly keypad, scrollable product list, always-accessible cart.
- Cart: Collapsible sections, summary always visible.
- Reports: Tabs/accordions for report types, responsive charts/tables.
- Settings: Stacked/collapsible sections, large toggles.

### Step 6: Testing & Safeguards
- Test all critical flows on real devices/emulators at each breakpoint.
- Add e2e/UI tests for mobile breakpoints.
- Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus, ARIA labels).

### Step 7: Documentation & Review
- Document responsive patterns and component usage.
- Update the development plan and progress docs with responsive milestones.
- Review with stakeholders and iterate.

## 4. References
- See `docs/development-plan.md` for overall project plan.
- See `docs/migration-progress.md` for ongoing progress tracking.

---

## 5. Progress Tracking
- All responsive work will be tracked in the progress document (`docs/migration-progress.md`).
- Each completed page/component will be checked off with notes on any critical changes.

---

## 6. Additional Notes
- Prioritize usability and performance on low-end devices.
- Maintain business logic and data fetching in services/hooks, not in UI components.
- Use Tailwind CSS or equivalent for rapid, consistent responsive styling.
